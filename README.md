# My PyTorch Playground

`linear-main.py` contains a Python file implementaion of what's done in Dan Bourke's **PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course** video, chapter 01, where naturally this is all captured in a Jupyter notebook, which I thought was a great course, and I did this as an extra-curricular activity.
